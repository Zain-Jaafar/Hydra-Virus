# Hydra-Virus
## As of right now, I am not sure if it will be possible to make this virus using pygame, but I will still try


This Hydra Virus is made with PyGame.
When you close a window, 2 other windows will open up.
If you press a certain combination of keyboard buttons (combination to be decided), then the program will stop.

work in progress
